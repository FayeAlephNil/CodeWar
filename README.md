# CodeWar [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/PhoenixTeamMC/CodeWar.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/PhoenixTeamMC/CodeWar)
This is a text-based RPG in which you code to defeat the enemies, which are errors.

An example fight:
```
> sword = weapon.new("sword")
=> true
> self.equip(sword)
=> true
> self.aim(sword, enemy)
=> true
> self.attack
=> true
The error has been defeated!
```
